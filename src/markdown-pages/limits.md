## Plans

Workers plans are separate from any Cloudflare plan (Free, Professional, Business) you may have. Everyone has access to the Free tier Workers platform by default and are subject to the [free tier request limits](#request-limits). Upgrading to the Unlimited (Paid) plan lifts the restrictions and increases your CPU time limit.

| Plan             | CPU Limit | Daily Request Limit | Burst Rate Limit         |
| ---------------- | --------- | ------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Free             | 10ms      | 100,000             | 1000 requests per 10 min |
| Unlimited (Paid) | 50ms      | none                | none                     |

See definitions for the types of limits and behavior below.
Script size, number of scripts, subrequests, and available memory are not affected by plan type.

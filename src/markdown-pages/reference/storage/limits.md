Workers KV supports:

- Up to 100 Namespaces per account
- Unlimited keys per Namespace
- Keys of up to 512 bytes
- Values of up to 10 MB
- Unlimited reads per second per key
- Up to one write per second per key

If your application requires higher limits, please [let us know](https://support.cloudflare.com).

Workers KV read performance is determined by the amount of read-volume a
given key receives. Maximum performance for a key is not reached unless that
key is being read at least a couple times per minute in any given data
center.

Workers KV is an eventually consistent system, meaning that reads will
sometimes reflect an older state of the system. While writes will often be
visible globally immediately, it can take up to 60 seconds before reads in
all edge locations are guaranteed to see the new value.
